                            <p>Although he's just turned 35, Manuel Neuer undoubtedly remains one of the best
                                goalkeepers in the game. It was his fifth Goalkeeper of the Year award, equalling the
                                record set by fellow goalkeeping greats, Iker Casillas and Gianluigi Buffon.</p>

                            <p>There's some madness in the concept that Thomas Muller is just damn good at everything -
                                without being too good anything. And he's especially good at the things that you don't
                                see. ... In his last three seasons at Bayern, Muller has hit over a combined total of 30
                                goals and assists for his club.Müller has enjoyed a highly successful international
                                career to date. Voted best young player at the World Cup in South Africa – where Germany
                                finished third - he also won the Golden Boot after scoring five goals and providing
                                three assists.</p>

                                Sane is a left-footed player who can operate on either flank as a winger. The German
                                possesses blistering pace and is one of the most fleet-footed attackers in the world.
                                Moreover, his finishing is superb and he has been a prolific goal-scorer and assist
                                provider for his club.

                                2017 against Denmark when he came in as a substitute.

                                Younes scored his first International goal against San Marino on 10 June 2017. In his
                                five appearances for the German national team, he has scored two goals and has an assist

                                reported fee of £29 million. In 2017, he was also part of the squad that won the 2017
